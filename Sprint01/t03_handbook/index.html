            <h4>&#60;div&#62;</h4>
            The &#60;div&#62;  tag is an empty container that is used to define 
            a division or a section. It does not affect the content or layout 
            and is used to group HTML elements to be styled with CSS or manipulated 
            with scripts.
            <h4>Syntax</h4>
            &#60;div&#62;Name&#60;div&#62;
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <div>Hello Bro</div>
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <h4>&#60;h1&#62;</h4>
            The &#60;h1&#62; to &#60;h6&#62; elements are used to define six levels of HTML 
        Headings, with &#60;h1&#62; being the highest (or most important) level 
        and &#60;h6&#62; the least important one.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;h1&#62;Text&#60;/h1&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <h1 class="example">Hello Bro</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <h4>&#60;main&#62;</h4>
            The &#60;main&#62; is a new block-level element in the HTML5 specification. 
        The tag specifies the dominant content of the document's &#60;body&#62;. 
        The content of the &#60;main&#62; tag must be unique and do not duplicate 
        blocks of the same type that are repeated in other documents, 
        such as the header of a site, header, footer, menu, search, 
        copyright information, etc.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;main&#62;Name&#60;/main&#62;
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <h4>&#60;footer&#62;</h4>
            The &#60;footer&#62; tag defines the footer of a web page 
        or a section. Usually, it contains copyright information, contact details, 
        navigation links, etc.
        You can have several &#60;footer&#62; tags on a web page. For example, you can 
        place a footer inside the &#60;article&#62; tag to store information related to 
        the article (links, footnotes, etc.).
        The tag can contain other HTML elements, except for the &#60;footer&#62; 
        and &#60;header&#62; tags.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;footer&#62;Name&#60;/footer&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>I'm footer</p>
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <h4>&#60;p&#62;</h4>
            The &#60;p&#62;  tag defines a paragraph of text. 
        It is a block-level element and always starts on a new line. 
        Before and after each paragraph, browsers add margin automatically. 
        You can modify the margins using the CSS margin property .
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;p&#62;Text&#60;/p&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>I'm paragraph</p>
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <h4>&#60;blockquote&#62;</h4>
            The &#60;blockquote&#62; tag is used to define long 
        quotes inside the document. Browsers usually indent &#60;blockquote&#62; elements.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;blockquote&#62;Hello&#60;/blockquote&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <blockquote>I'm blockquote</blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <h4>&#60;style&#62;</h4>
            The &#60;style&#62; HTML element contains styles for the document or part of it.
     In the absence of the &#60;type&#62; attribute, the instruction language inside this element is CSS.
         <h4>Syntax</h4>
         &#60;style type="text/css"/style&#62;
        </div>
        <div class="elements">
            <h4>&#60;hr&#62;</h4>
            The &#60;hr&#62;  tag is a block-level element 
        transferring all the elements after it to another line. 
        The external look of the horizontal line defined by the 
        tag depends on the type of the browser. More often it is 
        displayed with a border, which creates 3D effect.
        <h4>Syntax</h4>
        &#60;hr/&#62;
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <hr>
        </div>
    </div>

            <h4>background</h4>
            The background property is a shorthand property for:
            <ul>

                <li>background-attachment</li>
            </ul>
            It does not matter if one of the values above are missing.

              </ul>
              If border-color is omitted, the color applied will be the color of the text.

            <h4>Domain Name System (DNS)</h4>
        <p>The domain name system (DNS) gives us humans an easy way to identify where we want to go on the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>A domain name is a human-friendly address for a website, something that's easy for us to remember and type in.</p>
        <h4>Anatomy of a domain name</h4>
        <p>Each domain name is made up of parts:
            third-level-domain.second-level-domain.top-level-domain
            There are a limited set of top level domains (TLDs), and many 
            websites use the most common TLDs,".com", ".org", and ".edu".
            The third level domain is also called a subdomain, because it's owned by 
            the same group and that URL often directs you to a subset of the website, 
            like "m.wikipedia.org" (mobile-optimized Wikipedia) or "es.khanacademy.org" 
            (Spanish-language Khan Academy).</p>
            <p>Behind the scenes, each domain name maps to an IP address. 
                When we type a URL in the address bar of our browser, the 
                computer has to figure out its IP address.
            </p>
            <p>The computer can't store a database of more than 300 million 
                domain names locally, so it goes through a multi-step process 
                to find out the IP address.
            </p>

        <h4>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure(HTTPS)</h4>
            <p>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, 
                the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website 
                that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. 
                It means all communications between your browser and the website are 
                encrypted. HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online 
                transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.
                <p>To understand why HTTPS protocol, we first should know how wi-fi 
                    routers function.Let's say you are at an airport and you are connecting 
                    to the wi-fi which is the property of a third party. Now, when you are 
                    communicating over HTTP, the text is being transferred by their router. 
                    And if I go to a low version of the router, I can comfortably check and 
                    read the text that is being transferred. There could be a password that 
                    I can use to login to your bank site and do a fraudulent transaction!. 
                    Point being - 
                    this is fundamentally insecure. This is called the man in the middle attack. 
                    And this why do we need https when HTTP seems to suffice.
                    Now, to save our data from such attacks, we need to encrypt that data.</p>

                <h4>DNS Records</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>3 types of DNS queries</b>— recursive, iterative, and non-recursive</li>
                    <li><b>3 types of DNS servers</b> — DNS Resolver, DNS Root Server and Authoritative Name Server</li>
                    <li><b>10 types of common DNS records</b>— including A, AAAA, CNAME, MX and NS</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>DNS Types: 10 Top DNS Record Types</h3>
                <p>DNS servers create a DNS record to provide important information about 
                    a domain or hostname, particularly its current IP address. The most common DNS record types are: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Address Mapping record (A Record)—also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.</li>
                        <li>IP Version 6 Address record (AAAA Record)—stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv6 address.</li>
                        <li>Canonical Name record (CNAME Record)—can be used to alias a hostname to another hostname. When a DNS client requests a record that contains a CNAME, which points to another hostname, the DNS resolution process is repeated with the new hostname.</li>
                        <li>Mail exchanger record (MX Record)—specifies an SMTP email server for the domain, used to route outgoing emails to an email server.</li>
                        <li>Name Server records (NS Record)—specifies that a DNS Zone, such as “example.com” is delegated to a specific Authoritative Name Server, and provides the address of the name server. </li>
                        <li>Reverse-lookup Pointer records (PTR Record)—allows a DNS resolver to provide an IP address and receive a hostname (reverse DNS lookup).</li>
                        <li>Certificate record (CERT Record)—stores encryption certificates—PKIX, SPKI, PGP, and so on.</li>
                        <li>Service Location (SRV Record)—a service location record, like MX but for other communication protocols.</li>
                        <li>Text Record (TXT Record)—typically carries machine-readable data such as opportunistic encryption, sender policy framework, DKIM, DMARC, etc.</li>
                        <li>Start of Authority (SOA Record)—this record appears at the beginning of a DNS zone file, and indicates the Authoritative Name Server for the current DNS zone, contact details for the domain administrator, domain serial number, and information on how frequently DNS information for this zone should be refreshed.</li>
                    </ul>
