# EndGame_CardsBattle
Final project of the Marathon card game

Hello everyone!
This is the final project of the Marathon from Ucode. Ymyroniuk, matarasenk and lkisiura worked on the project.

The project is a simple card game. Only 2 users interact and the winner is determined among them.
We used such stacks as native JS, NodeJS and the mySQL database.

Thanks!
