                It had the ability to manipulate time, even in places "beyond" time, such as the Dark Dimension. It was
                contained inside the Eye of Agamotto under the protection of the Masters of the Mystic Arts, who swore
                to protect it. Doctor Strange came across the relic in Wong's library and used it to force a bargain

                used by various ancient civilizations before coming into Asgardian hands, kept inside Odin's Vault.
                Eventually, it was brought to Earth and left in Tønsberg, where it was guarded by devout Asgardian
                worshipers.</td>

                who received it as a gift from Thanos for the Chitauri Invasion. After the Battle of New York, the
                Scepter was confiscated by HYDRA, whose scientists used it to give extraordinary powers to the twins
                Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. After the fall of HYDRA, the Scepter was recovered by the Avengers. </td>

                (pronounced ēTHər), the Dark Elves and their leader Malekith intended to use it to revert the universe
                to its state of primordial darkness. The Aether was taken from the Elves by the Asgardians and entrusted
                to the Collector following the Second Dark Elf Conflict.</td>

                was highly likely to kill any organic beings that touched it. It was used by Eson the Searcher until it
                was hidden for millennia on the planet Morag inside the Orb.</td>
